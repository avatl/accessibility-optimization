This homework assignment was very difficult for me. I went in constant circles around my HTML trying to make all the functions work properly. 

I had the most difficulty with the 'digital-marketing-metting' image that it embedded in the CSS code. Everytime I thought I was done, the image would dissapear.

I am submitting my assignment now, but I don't believe my page is compatible for all screen sizes. 

I changed the div's to semantic tags where I saw fit.
